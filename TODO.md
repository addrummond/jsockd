- Turn jsockd_server/tests/e2e/sourcemaps/todo_not_yet_a_test.sh into a proper test
- CMakeLists.txts isn't completely "modern CMake". It still uses non-target-specific directives like 'add_compile_options'.
- Debug builds do some ad hoc logging without the log line prefix
- Include source map for shims bundle
